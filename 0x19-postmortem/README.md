**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM UTC on July 17, 2024.
- **Impact:** The web application experienced intermittent connectivity issues, causing a slowdown in service. Approximately 30% of users were affected, experiencing slow response times and occasional timeouts.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was traced to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, specifically affecting the routing of traffic to one of the backend servers.

**Timeline:**
- **10:00 AM UTC:** Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating increased latency and error rates.
- **10:10 AM UTC:** Engineers began investigating, suspecting a potential network issue or server overload.
- **10:30 AM UTC:** Misleadingly, attention focused on server memory utilization and database query performance.
- **11:00 AM UTC:** Issue escalated to senior engineering team for deeper investigation into load balancing configurations.
- **12:00 PM UTC:** Root cause identified as load balancer misconfiguration leading to uneven distribution of traffic.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused one of the backend servers to receive a disproportionate amount of traffic, exceeding its capacity and causing intermittent failures. To resolve the issue, engineers adjusted the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic among all backend servers.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements:** Enhance load testing procedures to simulate various traffic scenarios and ensure load balancer configurations are robust.
- **Specific Tasks:**
  - Update load balancer configurations to implement more accurate and responsive traffic routing.
  - Conduct thorough reviews of all network configurations quarterly to catch potential misconfigurations early.
  - Implement enhanced monitoring with automated alerts for load balancer metrics to quickly identify similar issues in the future.
